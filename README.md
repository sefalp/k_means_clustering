# k_means_clustering

Code Explanation
1) İn this code first I extracted data from the file to the array.
2) Than, choose randomly three data points in dataset as first cluster points.
3) According to dataset elements’ distance from cluster point define each of their clusters.
4) Than, find average point of each cluster to define new center cluster point.
5) So, with using these new center points find each data elements clusters.
6) Repeated 4th and 5th step till the reach termination condition (total distance change of clusters <
0.0001).
7) İn the end, plot dot graph for first and last clusters and line graph for objective function.
